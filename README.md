# Alibabance
This project involved creating a three-tiered web application developed by teams of three. The goal was to apply taught technologies like HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, Python, Flask, and MySQL. Teams had complete freedom in choosing the application's subject, data management, and appearance. The development 
process followed a step-by-step methodology, from problem definition to technical resolution. This project constituted a substantial part of the 
semester's assessment, providing a tangible opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge gained in class.
